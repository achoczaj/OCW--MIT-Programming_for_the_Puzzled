# Puzzle 2 - The Best Time to Party

# Given a list of intervals when celebrities will be at the party
# Output is the time that you want to go the party when the maximum number of
# celebrities are still there.

# Clever algorithm that will work with fractional times

# Exercise 3: There is an alternative way of computing the best time 
# to party that does not depend on the granularity of time. 
# We choose each celebrity interval in turn, 
# and determine how many other celebrity intervals 
# contain the chosen celebrityâ€™s start time. 
# We pick the time to attend the party to be the start time of the celebrity 
# whose start time is contained in the maximum number of other celebrity intervals. 
# Code this algorithm and verify that it produces the same answer 
# as the algorithm based on sorting.
